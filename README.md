## Projects
- **Where's Schueller** – Cleaned and visualized multi-year Google location traces in Python/Plotly to infer a professor’s routine, important locations, and questionable conclusions about their habits  
  _Tools: Python (Google Colab), pandas, Plotly, SciPy, geopy, JSON _  
  - Tested whether Schueller goes to the gym more often on weekdays than on weekends in 2025 using Google location history
  - Aggregated visits by day of week, plotted weekday vs. weekend gym visits, and ran a two-sample t-test (t = 3.39, p = 0.02), showing Schueller visits the gym significantly more on weekdays (≈13.4 visits) than weekends (7 visits)
